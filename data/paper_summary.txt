### **Title: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions**

**Author:** Thomas S. Kuhn
**Source:** *International Encyclopedia of Unified Science*, 1962 (This is based on the original seminal work).

**Abstract:**
This essay proposes a model for the development of scientific knowledge, challenging the cumulative, linear view of progress. It argues that science advances through alternating phases of "normal science" and "revolutionary science." Normal science operates within a dominant framework or "paradigm," which sets the puzzles to be solved. Anomalies that resist solution within the paradigm accumulate, leading to a crisis. This crisis is resolved by a scientific revolution, which replaces the old paradigm with an incommensurable new one. This paradigm shift represents not just new knowledge, but a fundamentally new way of seeing the world and practicing science.

### **1. Introduction: A Role for History**
The traditional image of science is one of continuous, cumulative progress. Historical study, however, reveals a more complex pattern. This essay utilizes historical case studies (e.g., the Copernican Revolution, the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics) to argue that the development of science is fundamentally *revolutionary*. The central concept introduced is the "paradigm" – a universally recognized scientific achievement that, for a time, provides model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners. Understanding the paradigm-based structure of scientific development is essential to comprehending scientific progress.

### **2. The Route to Normal Science**
Normal science is the practice of mopping-up operations guided by a paradigm. It is not aimed at novelty but at articulating and expanding the paradigm. This involves:
1.  Determining significant facts.
2.  Matching facts with theory.
3.  Articulating the paradigm theory itself.
Puzzlesolving within normal science is a highly focused activity; failure is attributed to the scientist, not the paradigm. The success of normal science lies in its ability to detail and extend the scope of the paradigm.

### **3. The Nature of Normal Science**
Normal science is a deeply conservative endeavor. Its aim is not to test the paradigm but to use it as a tool to solve puzzles. Research is directed by the paradigm's rules and standards, which are embedded in education and textbook tradition. This focused work is crucial, for it is by investigating the minute details of the paradigm that anomalies—phenomena the paradigm cannot explain—are discovered.

### **4. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries**
Discovery begins with the recognition of an anomaly – a violation of paradigm-induced expectations. Persistent anomalies (e.g., the orbit of Uranus pre-1846, black-body radiation) create a state of professional uncertainty. The process of discovery is therefore not instantaneous but extended, requiring both the recognition of the anomaly and a subsequent adjustment of the paradigm to accommodate it.

### **5. Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories**
When anomalies resist resolution and are perceived as fundamentally challenging the paradigm, a crisis state ensues. During a crisis, the rules of normal science relax. Scientists engage in philosophical debate, propose radical alternatives, and express explicit discontent. The crisis period, while destructive, is essential as it opens the field to a fundamental new theory. For example, the crisis in Ptolemaic astronomy paved the way for Copernicus.

### **6. Response to Crisis**
The scientific community does not abandon a paradigm at the first sign of difficulty. It is only when an alternative candidate paradigm is available that the rejection of the old one occurs. The decision between competing paradigms is not made by a simple algorithmic comparison, as they are often *incommensurable*—they see the world and define problems differently. Adherence to a new paradigm is thus based on factors like its promise for solving the crisis-inducing problems, its aesthetic appeal, and the conversion of influential scientists.

### **7. The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions**
A scientific revolution is a non-cumulative developmental episode in which an older paradigm is replaced, in whole or in part, by an incompatible new one. It is akin to a political revolution, where the existing institutions have failed and competing factions propose new frameworks. The necessity of revolutions stems from the nature of paradigm-bound normal science itself, which inevitably generates anomalies leading to crisis.

### **8. Revolutions as Changes of World View**
After a revolution, scientists work in a different world. The paradigm change alters the very perception of the data. For instance, where pre-Copernicans saw a setting sun, post-Copernicans see the horizon rising. This is not just an interpretation but a *gestalt shift*. The world itself is seen through a different lens, making communication between proponents of old and new paradigms profoundly difficult.

### **9. The Invisibility of Revolutions**
Because textbooks are rewritten after a revolution to present the new paradigm as the current, correct state of the field, the historical record is obscured. Science is portrayed as a direct, cumulative march to the present view. This pedagogy, while efficient for training practitioners, hides the revolutionary process and the existence of past paradigms, making revolutions "invisible."

### **10. Progress through Revolutions**
Is progress still possible in this revolutionary model? Kuhn argues yes, but progress must be redefined. It is not progress *toward* a predetermined truth, but progress *away from* previous problems. A new paradigm is successful because it solves the anomalies that crippled its predecessor and offers a new set of fruitful puzzles. Science evolves through paradigm shifts, not by linear accretion.
